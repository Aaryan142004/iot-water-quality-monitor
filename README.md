## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO, pH Sensor, TDS Sensor, Turbidity Sensor  
- **Backend & Cloud**: Firebase Realtime Database, Python  
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit  
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 Instance (Ubuntu)

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧪 **Live Water Monitoring**: Collects pH, TDS, and Turbidity from sensors and streams data to Firebase in real-time.  
- 🌊 **Lentic Ecosystem Support**: Calibrated for stagnant water bodies with typical pH ~6.5–8.5, turbidity ≤ 5 NTU, and TDS ≤ 500 ppm based on CPCB guidelines.  
- 📊 **Ecosystem Classification**: Classifies water safety using color-coded categories (Green / Yellow / Red) aligned with pollution thresholds.  
- 🌱 **Carbon Estimation**: Computes environmental impact using usage patterns, improving sustainability decisions.  
- 🔁 **Cloud Dashboard**: Always-on Streamlit dashboard for remote and field team access.

## 🌍 Real-World Context

- India has over **5 million** lentic water bodies, many of which suffer from unmonitored pollution and eutrophication.  
- Real-time monitoring can reduce manual testing costs by **80%**, and early detection enables preventive action.  
- The platform is designed to scale across agricultural ponds, village reservoirs, and urban wetlands.
